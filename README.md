Udacity Data analyst Nanodegree - Project 2

In this project, I gathered 3 datasets from 3 different sources, including using the tweepy library to access the Twitter API. 
I identified 8 data quality issues and 2 tidiness issues which I then cleaned using the define, code and test methodology.
After cleaning the data, I merged it into one master dataset, saved it and then made 3 insights and 2 visualisations on this master dataset.

Wrangle report details the procedure used to wrangle and analyse the datasets in a technical manner.
Act report details the insights and visualisations made and it was written for a blog post or magazine article.
